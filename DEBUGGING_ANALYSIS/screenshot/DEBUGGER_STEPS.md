# Debugging analysis
breakpoint 1:

Location: start state when the user selects whether to go left or right.
Breakpoint Explanation: This breakpoint is placed right after the user has made a decision but before the program updates its state based on that input.
State Variables:
currentState: 'start'
story.start.question: "Your adventure begins now. Do you want to go left or right?"
choices: [ { text: "Go left", nextState: "leftPath" }, { text: "Go right", nextState: "rightPath" } ]

breakpoint 2:
Location: Just before the choices are rendered as buttons (after answersElement.innerHTML = '').
Breakpoint Explanation: This breakpoint occurs right before the choices are dynamically created and displayed to the player. It helps us verify that the choices are correctly rendered each time a new question is shown.
